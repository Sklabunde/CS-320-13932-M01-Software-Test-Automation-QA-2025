The best way to ensure that my code is functional and secure is to include automated tests to verify that all of the stakeholders’ needs are met.  Then running test cases will verify that the code is functioning and that the tests are working appropriately.  One of the most important things to do prior to starting to write the code is to go over the user’s requirements. If there is anything that you need clarification on or that you feel is missing you should check with the stakeholder or with the project manager. Understanding those requirements is key to success program development.  I approach designing software section by section.  I start with the major requirements and then add in the smaller details troubleshooting as I go along.  I now have added in being able to write junit testing to automatically test the code I am writing.
